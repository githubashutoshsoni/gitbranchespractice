Opps I just installed vim
I like this editor inside vim.

I did some changes in new feature of this branch.
this is cool

someone else did some changes here.
And, that's disappointing.
cause I don'tknow how to deal with it.


ok, Now I know how to deal with this task..
let's see if i amm commiting a lot of changes from my current branch.
and someone is commiting a lot in the server branch and then I want to sync things up.. Let's see... here we go 1,2,3....


my second commit goes here...
